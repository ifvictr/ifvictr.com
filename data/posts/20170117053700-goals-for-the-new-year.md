After yet another **366 days**, it is finally another year. Hopefully this year, with the help of my friends and family, I can climb yet another mountain. But first and foremost, I need to get all my goals out of my head and into writing. A few of them are:

1. **Get comfortable with public speaking.** I've noticed improvement in this area over the past year, but still, the problem hasn't gone away entirely yet. I still studder (a lot) here and there.
2. **Develop at least three new software applications.** They can be something as simple as a bi-directional chatting application to a full-fledged social network. My next project will be a lot more ambitious than my previous one. I'm planning to continue practicing Node.js with all upcoming projects.
3. **Be a little more active physically.** This means spending less time in front of any electronic device (e.g. computer, phone, etc.), and doing something small like going out for a walk or going to the local pool and swimming a few laps. Not exercising has been the main cause of my increased feelings of laziness and decreased motivation to do things. I can't think as hard as I used to, and I'm having trouble performing simple memorization tasks. I might need to start working out soon (I don't even lift, too busy making apps), I'm _really_ behind compared to other guys the same age as me when it comes to personal fitness.
4. **Learn one new programming language.** [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org), [Go](https://golang.org/), and [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)) are the few potential candidates as of right now. Ruby is another language that can be used for web development, so I want to learn that so if I run into it in any projects, I'll be able to interpret what it does. Google's Go is a relatively new language, and it's been getting more and more popular among developers. C is a language for working with lower-level things, and ultimately gives you control of things closer to the physical hardware. That will come in handy if I ever decide to get involved in any sort of activity that involves robotics.
5. **Learn how to build a computer from scratch.** I'm more of a software kind of guy, but to truly know computers, I must have knowledge of both the software side and hardware side of it. I found myself feeling embarrassed awhile back when I heard a discussion containing lingo I did not know yet, such as BIOS, cores, and SSD. I've learned a bit more about hardware, but I have a long way to go before I am actually knowledgeable.
