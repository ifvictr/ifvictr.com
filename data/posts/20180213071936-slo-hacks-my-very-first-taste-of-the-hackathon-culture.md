## Preface

I first discovered the concept of hackathons in 2016 when I found a project my friends made for an online hackathon called [hack.summit()](https://hacksummit.org). As a student who would most likely prioritize their programming side projects over homework, the concept of devoting an entire weekend to coding and learning new technologies immediately captivated me. I've heard people say how they were able to learn in 36 hours the amount of material which would usually take weeks to teach in school, and I've also heard how hackathons have single-handedly changed the course people's lives. All of this sounded awe-inspiring, but I didn't feel that such an intense, fast-paced environment would suit me well, and as a result, I dismissed the idea of attending a hackathon. It would be two, whole years before I finally got a firsthand taste of hackathons.

## Applying and getting accepted

Last year, I joined a community called [Hack Club](https://hackclub.com), in which I met many other high schoolers who shared the same passion as I had for coding. Many of them weren't simply spending their weekends alone at home coding like I did—instead, they were attending hackathons, working in teams, winning prizes, and probably the most fulfilling of all, meeting new people and fostering new friendships. Now realizing how impactful these gatherings were, I wanted to fully immerse myself in the hackathon culture by attending as many of them as possible. So when 2018 kicked off, I made it one of my primary goals for the year to attend at least six hackathons. My search for upcoming events eventually led to [SLO Hacks](https://www.slohacks.com), a 24-hour-long collegiate hackathon that would take place at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo.

When SLO Hacks opened their applications, I applied, but with severe doubts in regards to my attendence. Could I even make the four-hour trip? Would my parents let me? These questions lingered, until this arrived in my inbox:

No matter what, I needed to make it there. I couldn't let distance determine whether or not I'd go—this opportunity wasn't going to slip by that easily. Not long after, I found that traveling by train would be the most economical method of transportation.

Now I needed a place to stay, because the train that I was planning to take (also the only one available) would arrive there the night before the actual event. I don't have any relatives around San Luis Obispo, but thankfully, my friend Selynna, who also happened to be the founder of the event offered to host me for the night. My trip plan was now two-thirds complete.

The only thing I needed now was a computer to bring. It might come as a shock to you, but I actually don't have my own laptop. My mom refused to lend her laptop to me, so I had to ask my friends if they were willing to lend their laptop to me to use for a weekend. Fortunately (again), Selynna offered to lend me her spare laptop.

Everything looked good now. I had transportation, a place to stay, and most importantly, a computer. Now comes the wait.

## T minus two weeks

I spent everyday in the weeks leading up the hackathon thinking about how it would go. I was **hyped**. I even dreamt about how the whole event would go in my sleep. This was also going to be the first time ever that I met someone who I had only known online previously in-person. This would be a huge milestone.

I registered for the hackathon on Devpost. I joined the Slack, and began searching for teammates. No one responded. :(

Some minor changes have been made to my plan at this point. My parents didn't want me riding a train alone, deeming it a safety risk, so my dad would drive me instead (thanks for taking a day off work!). Also, my mom changed her mind about lending her laptop, so I used her's instead.

## T minus zero days

The drive to San Luis Obispo would take about three hours, my trip started at 3am in the morning, giving us ample time to navigate in case we got lost (which luckily we didn't).

I prepared everything three days in advance. Having heard the horror stories of people leaving essential items like laptop chargers and deodorant at home, my to-bring list ended up as compilation of information from ten different sites. I ended up bringing all of the following with me:

<!-- Feels a bit extra -->
- Laptop with charger
- Phone with charger
- Watch
- Earphones
- School-issued ID
- Hoodie (very useful at night)
- One set of spare clothing
- Small stick of deodorant
- Sleeping bag
- Computer mouse
- Trash bag (the ultimate swag collection tool)
- Notebook with pencil
- Toothbrush and toothpaste
- Tic Tacs (in case I was too busy to brush my teeth)

In hindsight, I probably could've left half that at home and still have be fine. I actually brought so many things that I had to use a luggage!

## Day 1

## Day 2

## Things I learned

I walked in thinking that building a hack in 24 hours would be easy. I couldn't have been more far from the truth. As I found out firsthand, a good portion of the time will be spent on learning how to use new technologies (if you do decide to take that route).

## Advice

- Don't build a team in advance if you want to maximize the amount your networking opportunities. By committing to a team before the event, you're locking yourself in to a group of people.
- Build a sizable list of ideas beforehand. This will save you and your team (if you do choose to team) from spending a few hours ideating, giving you more time to actually _build_.
- Get a rough idea of what stack you'll be using for your hack. If you plan to work with technologies with whom you've had no prior experience with, try to learn as much about them as possible. I spent a substantial amount of time learning React.js and regular expressions.
- Don't be afraid to talk to other people. The environment is very open and friendly. Most—if not all—of the other people are open to having a conversation (unless they're asleep), and are willing to show you what they're building. This is also a networking opportunity.
- Document the event by taking more pictures. It's pictures or it didn't happen. (this is actually self-advice. Because I didn't take enough pictures, I left gaps in the photo timeline)
- Get some sleep if you find yourself going in circles and writing janky code. One hour of sleep can go a long way.
- Use the energy drinks and caffeinated drinks provided. I tried Monster for the first time ever that weekend, and I was able to stay up for 36 hours straight (a personal feat!).
- Get your hands on as much swag as possible, and get as many promo codes as you can get away with (be considerate of other hackers, however!).
